                <h4 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h4>
                <i>1st level astromancer feature</i>
                <p>You have learned to use the power of the stars to create, destroy and alter the world around you. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the astromancer spell list.</p>
                <h4>Cantrips</h4>
                <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the astromancer spell list. You learn additional astromancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Astromancer table.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 23px;">Preparing and Casting Spells</p>
                <p>The Astromancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your astromancer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
                    when you finish a long rest.
                    <br><br>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.
                    <br><br>You prepare the list of astromancer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the astromancer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your astromancer level
                    (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
                    <br><br>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 23px;">Spellcasting Ability</p>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your astromancer spells. Your magic comes from the power and force of the lights that dot the sky. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
                    Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
                    <br><br>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
                    <br><br>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p style="font-size: 23px;">Ritual Casting</p>
                <p>You can cast an astromancer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 23px;">Spellcasting Focus</p>
                <p>You can use a Spyglass, Glassblower’s Tools, or any arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your astromancer spells.</p>
